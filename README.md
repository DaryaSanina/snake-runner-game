# Snake runner
This is a runner game based on a popular snake arcade game.

There are 5 lines and a road on them. You play as a snake. The snake needs
to follow this road. If you went out of the road, the game is over.

The main goal is to get ***as much score as possible***.

There are monsters on the road. If the snake touches them, the game is over.
A monster can be destroyed by clicking on it a specific number of times.
This number is written on the monster.

Also there are apples on the road. You can collect these apples and buy
items on them (skins, boosters, etc.)
